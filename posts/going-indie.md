It definitely wasn't an easy decision to quit my job at [ClearVoyage](https://clearvoyage.com). The people there are a joy to work with, and the work is mostly interesting.

However, it felt like the right time. The decision was also made easier by the fact that I already had a few things going...

## Freelancing

I have been doing freelance development work for more than 7 years. Back when I started, my average "contract" was around $50, mostly doing WordPress maintenance.

Now, I regularly do work for $5-10K. Still nothing massive, but often enough to pay for rent and food. Having this *definitely* made the decision easier, as it lowered the risk significantly.

## Mobile App for high schoolers

In Denmark, most high schools use the same system to handle schedules, assignments, grades and communication - [Lectio](https://lectio.dk). It was built in the nineties and, unsurprisingly, it is not very mobile friendly.

A user-built solution was made. As almost every high schooler in Denmark uses this system, it very quickly gained a lot of traction.

Back in December 2020, I bought the app for $25K. Today, it brings in about $1-2K a month. Also a huge deal in lowering the risk.

## Savings

Perhaps most importantly, throughout the last few years, I have built enough savings to last for a few years, even if everything goes wrong with the other projects.

## The decision

I am incredibly fortunate to be in a position where I can quit my job with almost no risk to my financial situation. At this point, the only thing I'm risking is my time.

When I first made the decision, I was still worried whether it was right or not. However, as I spoke to friends and family, I realised that every conversation made me more certain. It was the right thing for me.

## Going forward

So, what am I going to do, now that I don't have a full time job?

I will be focusing on 3 things:

1. Improving the Lectio app mentioned earlier
2. Building an audience
3. BravoApps

The two first are self-explanatory. But what is BravoApps?

### BravoApps

When companies outsource the development of their mobile app, they often think it is a one time deal. The app is developed and released. Case closed.

In reality, an app (obviously) needs to be maintained. This can be quite a pain. Traditionally, you either hire a freelancer or an agency. The freelancer can quit at any time, and the agency is often quite expensive.

With either solution, you often end up paying for a specific number of hours (on retainer) every month. This means you need to use **exactly** the right amount of hours. Otherwise you (1) have wasted a number of hours you have already paid for _or_ (2) you have to buy extra hours, often at a premium.

I want to solve that with _BravoApps_. It is a productized service that offers _unlimited_ app development work on a _fixed price_ subscription.

You know exactly what you are going to pay. And you will get the app development work you need.

I have just released a landing page for it: [BravoApps](https://bravoapps.dk).

Now back to building!
